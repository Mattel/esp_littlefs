    config LITTLEFS_MAX_PARTITIONS
        int "Maximum Number of Partitions"
        default 3
        range 1 10
        help
            Define maximum number of partitions that can be mounted.

    config LITTLEFS_PAGE_SIZE
        int "Logical page size"
        default 256
        range 256 1024
        help
            Logical page size of LittleFS partition, in bytes. Must be multiple
            of flash page size (which is usually 256 bytes).
            Larger page sizes reduce overhead when storing large files, and
            improve filesystem performance when reading large files.
            Smaller page sizes reduce overhead when storing small (< page size)
            files.

    config LITTLEFS_OBJ_NAME_LEN
        int "Maximum object name length including NULL terminator."
        default 64
        range 16 1024
        help
            Includes NULL-terminator.

    config LITTLEFS_READ_SIZE
        int "Minimum size of a block read."
        default 128
        help
            Minimum size of a block read. All read operations will be a
            multiple of this value.

    config LITTLEFS_WRITE_SIZE
        int "Minimum size of a block write."
        default 128
        help
            Minimum size of a block program. All program operations will be a
            multiple of this value.

    config LITTLEFS_LOOKAHEAD_SIZE
        int "Look ahead size."
        default 128
        help
            Look ahead size. Must be a multiple of 8.

    config LITTLEFS_CACHE_SIZE
        int "Cache Size"
        default 128
        help
            MUST be a multiple of Read AND Write size. MUST be a factor of 4096.

    config LITTLEFS_BLOCK_CYCLES
        int "Wear-leveling block cycles"
        default 512
        range -1 1024
        help
            Suggested values are in the range 100-1000, with large values having 
            better performance at the cost of less consistent wear distribution. 
            -1 disables wear-leveling.

    config LITTLEFS_USE_MTIME
        bool "Save file modification time"
        default "y"
        help
            Saves timestamp on modification. Uses an additional 4bytes.

            Help

        config LITTLEFS_MTIME_USE_SECONDS
            bool "Use Seconds"
            help
                Saves timestamp on modification.

        config LITTLEFS_MTIME_USE_NONCE
            bool "Use Nonce"
            help
                Saves nonce on modification. Uses an additional 4bytes.
                A file who's nonce is the same as it was at a previous time has 
                high probability of not having been modified.

                Upon file modification, the nonce is incremented by one. Upon file
                creation, a random nonce is assigned.

                There is a very slim chance that a file will have the same nonce if
                it is deleted and created again (approx 1 in 4 billion).
